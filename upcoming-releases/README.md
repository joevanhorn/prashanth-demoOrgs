## Best Practices

### Writing Release Plans

**Do:**
- ✅ Break large features into manageable phases
- ✅ Define clear success criteria
- ✅ Identify dependencies early
- ✅ Include testing strategy
- ✅ Update plan as you go
- ✅ Document decisions and rationale

**Don't:**
- ❌ Create phases that are too large
- ❌ Skip testing or validation steps
- ❌ Forget to update status
- ❌ Leave open questions unresolved
- ❌ Over-plan distant phases (they will change)

### Managing Releases

**Keep it Current:**
- Update progress weekly (or after major milestones)
- Check off completed items immediately
- Document blockers as they occur
- Revise estimates based on actual effort

**Communicate:**
- Reference plan in PR descriptions
- Link to specific phases in commits
- Update plan in review feedback
- Celebrate completed phases! 🎉

## Completed Releases

Move completed plans to `completed-releases/` directory (create if needed):

```bash
mkdir -p completed-releases
mv FEATURE_NAME_PLAN.md completed-releases/
```

Or delete if no longer needed for reference.
