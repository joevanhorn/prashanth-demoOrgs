# Okta Identity Governance -- GitOps Template

A GitOps template for managing Okta Identity Governance using Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Python automation. Fork it to manage your Okta tenants as code -- from simple demos to production environments.

---

## Quick Start

### Path 1: AI-Assisted Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to get a complete environment running -- Okta resources **and** infrastructure.

1. Fill out the [Demo Deployment Worksheet](demo-builder/DEMO_WORKSHEET.md) (Okta users/groups/apps + AD, Generic DB, OPA, SCIM infrastructure)
2. Open Claude Code in this repository
3. Paste the completed worksheet with the [deployment prompt](ai-assisted/prompts/deploy_full_environment.md)
4. Claude deploys everything -- Terraform, infrastructure, verification -- pausing for your approval at each step

### Path 2: Demo Builder

Generate Terraform from a YAML config file.

1. Copy an example: `cp demo-builder/examples/healthcare-demo.yaml demo-builder/my-demo.yaml`
2. Customize the YAML
3. Generate: `python scripts/build_demo.py --config demo-builder/my-demo.yaml`
4. Apply: `cd environments/myorg/terraform && terraform init && terraform apply`

### Path 3: Full GitOps Setup

Production-grade workflow with PRs, approval gates, and CI/CD.

## Architecture

This repository uses a three-layer resource management model:

- **Layer 1 -- Terraform** manages the core Okta resources: users, groups, apps, entitlement bundles, access reviews, approval sequences, and catalog entries. All configuration lives in `environments/{env}/terraform/*.tf` files.
- **Layer 2 -- Python API Scripts** handle governance features not yet in the Terraform provider: resource owners, governance labels, risk rules (SOD policies), and entitlement settings. Configuration lives in `environments/{env}/config/*.json` files.
- **Layer 3 -- Manual (Okta Admin UI)** covers entitlement bundle assignments (which users/groups have which bundles), access review decisions, and certain advanced OIG configurations.

**GitOps workflow:**

```
Branch --> PR (plan runs automatically) --> Review --> Merge --> Apply (with approval gate)
```

Each environment maintains independent Terraform state in S3 with DynamoDB locking. GitHub Actions authenticate to AWS via OIDC -- no long-lived credentials required.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Okta tenant** | With API token (Super Admin or equivalent). OIG features require Identity Governance license. |
| **Terraform** | >= 1.9.0 with Okta provider >= 6.4.0 |
| **Python** | >= 3.8 with `requests`, `pyyaml`, `python-dotenv` (see `requirements.txt`) |
| **GitHub account** | For GitOps workflows (optional for local-only usage) |
| **AWS account** | Optional -- for S3/DynamoDB state backend and infrastructure modules |
